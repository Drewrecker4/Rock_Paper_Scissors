## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Continued development

I am satisfied with the final result for now, although I would like to add additional CSS to modernize my project look. I also want to fix the "winner", "loser", and "draw" popups. The popups' opactiy transition are not smooth the first time they appear, although they work as expected every time after their first appearance.
